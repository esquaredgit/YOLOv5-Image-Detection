# YOLOv5 Image Detection - Final Group Project

Ethan Eldridge, Gavin Hemmerlein

This repo contains the code and supporting documents we created for our final project in a graduate class on computer vision methods. This program adapts a YOLOv5 model, pretrained on the COCO dataset, to the problem of image detection in a relatively small aquarium dataset. For more information on my motivation for this project and the details of its construction, read the project report included in this repo.
