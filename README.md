[Github Repo Here](https://github.iu.edu/cs-b657-sp2021/tdash-etmeldr-ghemmer-alavania-wilswang-a1/tree/master/finalProject) This area will include all of the files contained within the .ZIP file.

[Jupyter Notebook with Code](https://github.iu.edu/cs-b657-sp2021/tdash-etmeldr-ghemmer-alavania-wilswang-a1/blob/master/finalProject/CSCI_B657_FinalProject_GHEE_Clean.ipynb) This file had to have the outputs stripped to load on to GIT. The final trained models were in the 40 - 80 GB range. This file includes links to the multiple sets of data that we used. It also has comments embedded within the code. To duplicate the results, one would only have to rerun the cells and follow the instructions.
